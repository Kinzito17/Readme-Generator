# Readme-Generator

## About

The Readme generator is a nodejs command line program. When a user runs the program they are prompted to answer questions about their project. The answers are then passed in to a markdown generator function which will format the answers appropriately. Lastly a write file function is executed which creates the readme.md file.

Please find the readme.md file written from the program in the utils folder.
